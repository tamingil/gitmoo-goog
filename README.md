# gitmoo-goog

A [Google Photos](http://photos.google.com/) backup tool.

`gitmoo-goog` tool uses [Google Photos API](https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/get-started#enable-the-api) to continously download all photos on a local device.

It can be used as a daemon to keep in sync with a google-photos account.

* Download the client configuration.

### Configure gitmoo-goog:

* Copy the downloaded `credentials.json` to the same folder with `gitmoo-goog` .
* run `gitmoo-goog`, and follow the provided link:
* Sign in, and click `Allow`
* Copy the `token` and paste it in the cli.

This is probably not what you want, hit `crt-c` to stop it.

### Usage:

```
Usage of ./gitmoo-goog:
  -album string
        use albumID to limit download to specific album (https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/list#listing-albums)
  -folder string
        backup folder
  -force
        ignore errors, and force working
  -logfile string
        log to this file
  -loop
        loops forever (use as daemon)
  -max int
        max items to download (default 2147483647)
  -throttle int
        Time, in seconds, to wait between API calls (default 5)
```

On Linux, running the following is a good practice:

```
$ ./gitmoo-goog -folder archive -logfile gitmoo.log -loop -throttle 45 &
```

This will start the process in background, making an API call every 45 seconds, looping forever on all items and saving them to `{pwd}/archive`. 

Logfile will be saved as `gitmoo.log`.

#### Naming

Files are created as follows:

`[folder][year][month][day]_[hash].json` and `.jpg`. The `json` file holds the metadata from `google-photos`.
